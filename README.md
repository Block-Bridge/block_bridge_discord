# BlockBridge Discord Bot #
BlockBridge is a Utility/Api for connecting Minecraft with Discord Servers

## Prerequisites ##
In order to run the bot you will need the following:
1) A Discord Bot Token
2) Either a Pterodactyl/Multicraft Panel or a VPS/Dedicated Server

## Installation ##
There are two ways to install the bot, either by using a pre-built panel (like Pterodactyl or Multicraft) or by using a VPS/Dedicated Server.
### Pterodactyl/Multicraft Panel ###
For this installation method you will need some technical knowledge and access to the server's file system. I will not be going over specifics for each panel, however you can join the Discord for help on specific panel installations.
#### Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://ci.vanillaflux.com)

#### Create a new server on your panel

#### Upload the bot jar file to the root of your server
Once you have the jar file uploaded, to the root of the server, verify that your server jar file is set to the bot jar file.

#### Start the server
On first launch you should generate a bunch of errors, this is normal. The bot will generate a config file and then stop. Edit the config file.

#### Launch the server again
Once you have edited the config file, start the server again. The bot should now be running.

### VPS/Dedicated Server ###
